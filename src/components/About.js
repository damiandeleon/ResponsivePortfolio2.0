                                            I started my career in business after graduating college. For the years between 1997
                                            to 2020, I worked in the contact center industry. My professional career in Austin
                                            was devoted to Concentrix Corp. I had much success with the company between 2003 -
                                            2020. However I decided that I
                                            wanted to try something completely different in a new emerging industry. Web
                                            Development and
                                            coding was something that I knew would give me the exciting challenge I was seeking.
                                            I am excited to
                                            make it my new career.

                                            Throughout my life I have been fortunate to make the most of my humble
                                            beginnings. I grew up in a working-className family.  I
                                            was inspired by the work ethic my parents practiced. That became my mantra.
